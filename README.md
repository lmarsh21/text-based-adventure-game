# Text-Based Adventure Game (C++)

This project is a text-based adventure game developed as a course project at Monterey Peninsula College.

## Overview
The program allows a user to navigate through interconnected rooms using text-based commands. Rooms can be created, connected, renamed, and described dynamically during gameplay.

## Features
- Object-oriented design using a `Room` class
- Directional room connections (north, south, east, west) using pointers and enums
- Dynamic creation and connection of rooms at runtime
- Command-based interface for navigation and room editing
- Storage of rooms using STL containers (`map`, `vector`)

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)

## What I Learned
- Designing and managing class relationships in C++
- Working with pointers and dynamic memory
- Implementing destructors to prevent memory leaks
- Structuring a multi-file C++ project

## How to Run
Compile using a standard C++ compiler (for example, g++):
